                        This was an exercise in building a website entirely from a Photoshop design. I 
                        was left to determine and build the structure and style from the image provided.

                        On this project I was introduced to bulding a website from a Photoshop design. I 
                        was shown how to get measurements, structure, and style elements from the design 
                        and implement them into HTML and CSS.

                        This design project was an introduction to working with flex layouts. My job on 
                        this project was to use flex to create a design for the provided text.

                <p>
                    It started with a curiosity about how websites work, how do they function, how are 
                    they built. Before I knew it I was taking classes online and building them myself. 
                    I enjoy being able to imagine a website and write some code to make it come to life.
